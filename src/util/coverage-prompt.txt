Apply the following instructions to the test code to prepare it for code coverage measurements:
1. Add "const MCR = require("monocart-coverage-reports");" before setting the timeout
2. Add "const coverageReport = MCR({name: "My Coverage Report", outputDir: "./coverage-reports", reports: ["v8"], sourceFilter: {'**/node_modules/**': false, '**/src/app/components//**': true,},});" as variable to the test (after setting the timeout)
3. Add "await page.coverage.startJSCoverage();" at the beginning of each test
4. Add "const coverage = await page.coverage.stopJSCoverage();" and "await coverageReport.add(coverage);" at the end of each test
5. Add "await coverageReport.generate();" as the last code line of the last test (directly after "await coverageReport.add(coverage);")
